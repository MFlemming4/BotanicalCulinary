Hello, this is my submission for the 2021 UTD HackReason Hackathon. 
This was my first attempt at writing Prolog code and my first time using the s(CASP) tool.
The purpose of tis project is to provide logic that cna be used to distinguish between culinary and botanical fruits, vegetables, and nuts. 
I thought it was interesting that the botanical and culinary definitions of these foods differ so much.

A botanical fruit possesses seeds and is develops from the plant's ovary (flower).
A culinary fruit is sweet, may or may not have seeds, is widely considered to be a fruit/resembles a fruit, and it is not a nut.
A botanical vegetable technically doesn't exist. It's just the non-flowering part of the plant,
 some botanists don't even recognize the existence of "vegetables".
A culinary vegetable is just any edible plant that is not a fruit or nut. They're ususally more savory than sweet.
A botanical nut is a botanical flower that possesses a shell.
A culinary nit is any dry edible fruit or seed that has a shell.

By using this logic, s(CASP) can figure out which of the example foods in the program fall into each category.
